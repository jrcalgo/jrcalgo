## Hey, I’m Jackson 👋

AI systems engineer in the making. I get a kick out of turning research ideas into fast, testable code — usually with **Rust** or **C/C++** for performance and **Python** for experimentation/flexibility.

### 🔧 What I Build
- **Reinforcement- & deep-learning algorithms** — from classic q-learning/policy-gradients to encoder-based/transformer-based processes
- **Distributed RL frameworks** for HPC and robotics
- **Experimental OS Research** ranging from the kernel to interactions with userland
- **Neurosymbolic SAT engines** that blend logic with learning
- **Generative UX tools** — e.g., GAN-driven mouse-trajectory synthesis, adaptive song equalizer pipeline, etc.
- **Computer-vision apps** that leverage CV models for real-time use

### 🌟 Featured Projects
